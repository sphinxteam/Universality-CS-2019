# On the Universality of Noiseless Linear Estimation with Respect to the Measurement Matrix
## Alia Abbara (main author), with Antoine Baker, Florent Krzakala and Lenka Zdeborov√°

These are the demo file for the paper "On the Universality of Noiseless Linear Estimation with Respect to the Measurement Matrix". It uses the AMP and the VAMP algorithms for Noiseless Linear Estimation with different type of random matrices to illustrates the universality of the information theoretic MMSE and of the algorithms.
